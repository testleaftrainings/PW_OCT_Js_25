File Upload
Automating file uploads through web forms is crucial for testing upload 
functionalities.

// Setting files on input elements to simulate file selection
await page.setInputFiles('#upload-selector', 'path/to/file.txt');

setFiles
// Interacting with file chooser dialogs
const [fileChooser] = await Promise.all([
    page.waitForEvent('filechooser'),
    page.click('#upload-btn')
]);
await fileChooser.setFiles('path/to/file.txt');




File Downloads with Playwright
Automating file downloads ensures the correct handling of files from web applications. This guide covers managing the download process and saving the downloaded files to a specific location using Playwright.

Download Event and suggestedFilename To manage the download process and retrieve the suggested filename, use the download event in combination with the suggestedFilename() method.

const fileDownloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
await page.getByRole('button', {name:'Download'}).click();
const fileDownloader = await fileDownloadPromise;
console.log('Suggested Filename:', download.suggestedFilename());
In this example, Playwright waits for the download event to be triggered by clicking on the download link. Once the download starts, it logs the suggested filename.

Saving the Downloaded File To save the downloaded file to a specific location, use the download.path() method along with the saveAs() method.

Example
const path = await download.path(); await download.saveAs('/path/to/save/file'); This example demonstrates how to retrieve the path of the downloaded file and save it to a specified location on your filesystem.
